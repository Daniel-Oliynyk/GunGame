GunGame
=======
A very nice game I coded in processing. You're only task is to kill the rest of the bots in the level. Contains different bot types (large / juggernaut bot still a bit buggy), different guns a level and shop menu, and and easy text file level creation format. Money is gained through kills and can be used to buy weapons.
Controls:
- WASD to move.
- Mouse1 to shoot.
- M for menu.
- B for shop.
- WS / arrow keys + enter to navigate menus.
- Q for grenade.
- R to reload.
- Current start money is 1000, however that can be changed in line 12 of file FinalPro.pde.
Have fun.
